# Waste-segregation
Waste segregation facilitates the process of reuse, recycling, and recovery of waste. Segregating waste can improve the recycling process. For example, separating wet waste from dry waste is a simple way to help recycling companies. It will help to recycle non-biodegradable waste and treat biodegradable waste directly.
